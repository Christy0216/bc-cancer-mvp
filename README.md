# Project Setup Instructions

This document provides the steps necessary to get the backend and frontend of the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have `npm` installed on your computer. You can check this by running `npm -v` in your terminal. If you do not have npm installed, download and install it from [npm's official site](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Setup and Running the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
   Then, install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:
   Start the backend server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.

3. **Testing the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

## Setup and Running the Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
   Then, install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Application**:
   Start the frontend application with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the application in your default web browser.

## Accessing the Application

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the frontend of the application in your web browser at the default address (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

For any additional information on project configuration or troubleshooting, please refer to the project documentation or contact the development team.
